Reflections on my first html development project on UDACITY GOOGLE DEVELOPER CHALLENGE

You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
 

 * What new skills have you learned?
  

Everything is new for me in web development and coding.

 * What has been easy?
  

The whole environment of the tutorized lessons make the learning easier, even for non-English people.

 * What has been difficult?

  
It has not been difficult, just entertaining, searching for codes and solutions (at MDN and other pages), structuring and ordering, testing elements also was great!

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
